                        <p className="destination-item-data">Landlocked Rwanda is characterized by undulating hilly and mountainous terrain, with rainforest on the western heights and heavily-cultivated fields in the valleys below. From the central areas, the land slopes away to the
                            savannahs and marshes of the east. Considered the most densely-populated country in Africa with a predominantly rural population, Rwanda is as well known for its traumatic history, including the 1994 genocide, as for its courageous recovery to become a stable, well-run and united country with a truly inspiring story. Today, it is characterized by revival, recovery and renaissance!</p>

                    <h2 className="title">More Information</h2>
                    <b className="Content-data">Visas</b>

                    <b className="Content-data">When Packing</b>
                    <p className="Content-data">Do not forget a windbreaker or a light raincoat. When tracking gorillas you will be in a rainforest, so it will more likely than not rain, and you will also need good hiking boots, and a hat. Garden gloves, to avoid stinging nettles, and gators, are recommended. A light sweater for the evenings is recommended. If you swim, bring your swimming costume, the main hotels in Kigali all have swimming pools. If your itinerary includes Lake Kivu at either Kibuye or Gisenyi you will have the opportunity to swim in the lake.</p>

                    <b className="Content-data">Credit Cards</b>

Only the major hotels in Kigali and Kivu Sun Hotel in Gisenyi plus a few airlines accept them, so make sure you have sufficient cash on you at all times.</p>

Work often includes general cleaning and other activities like breaking fallow ground for farming, unblocking trenches and roadside drains, sweeping the streets, etc. After work, communities have a short meeting [Inama] to discuss general societal issues and then go back home.
